# LessPaper

LessPaper is a full-stack digital examination system designed to replace traditional paper-based coding exams with a secure, monitored, and scalable digital environment.

The platform combines a FastAPI backend, a React-based instructor dashboard, and a Python desktop application with a custom-built anti-cheat “Kiosk Mode” system.

It was built to modernize academic assessment workflows while maintaining exam integrity.
# Key Features
🛡️ Anti-Cheat Kiosk Mode
Locks the workstation in fullscreen, prevents app switching, and blocks exit shortcuts until submission.

💻 Secure Coding Environment
Dedicated code editor interface for structured exam responses.

📊 Instructor Analytics Dashboard
Real-time monitoring tools and activity visualization.

🖼️ Dynamic Multimedia Support
Exams can include images and diagrams served directly from the backend.

💾 Auto-Save Protection
Student answers are saved locally every 30 seconds to prevent data loss.
# System Architecture 

The project is organized into modular components to separate instructor administration from student execution:

    backend/: The FastAPI hub that manages the database and serves images.

    prof/profweb/: The React-based Teacher Portal for exam management.

    student/: The Python-based Desktop environment for students.

# Launch Instructions (Step-by-Step)

To run the entire project, you must open three separate terminals and follow this exact order:
1. Start the Backend (API Server)

The backend must be running first so the interfaces can connect to the database.
Bash

cd backend
# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
# Start the server using Uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --reload

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
2. Start the Teacher Web Portal
Bash

cd prof/profweb
npm install       # Only needed the first time
npm run dev

Access the dashboard at http://localhost:5173.
3. Launch the Student Application
Bash

cd student
source venv/bin/activate
python lesspaper.py

Custom anti-cheat module
# Anti-Cheat Security (Kiosk Mode)

The anticheat.py module enforces academic integrity through:

    Native Fullscreen: Overrides window decorations to cover the entire screen.

    Topmost Window: Keeps the application above all other system windows.

    Focus Capture: Automatically re-claims focus if the student tries to switch apps.

    Close Prevention: Blocks exit commands like Alt+F4 until the exam is submitted.
